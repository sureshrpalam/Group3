			<h3> What are Lung Functional Tests</h3>
			<p>If you have asthma, or are suspected to have it, you will need to have lung function (breathing) tests.</p>
			
			<p>These tests check how well your lungs are working and how asthma affects your breathing. Two types of breathing tests are used for asthma – spirometry and peak 
			flow measurement.</p>
			
			<h3>Spirometry Breathing Tests</h3>
			<p>Spirometry is the most accurate breathing test for asthma. It measures the amount of air you can breathe in and out of your lungs, and how hard and fast you can 
			breathe out. In other words, it measures your overall lung function.</p>
			
			<p>The machine used to do the test is called a spirometer. Doctors use a spirometer to:</p>
			<div class="row", align='Justify'>
			<ul>
				<li>Check whether the airways in your lungs are narrower than they should be</li>
				<li>Confirm whether you have asthma</li>
				<li>Work out how severe your asthma is</li>
				<li>See if your asthma is getting worse</li>
				<li>See if your asthma is getting better with treatment.</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			
			<p>The test results help you and your doctor to decide whether you need any medicines, or to work out whether the type or dose of your current medicine needs to change.
			Most adults and children over 7 years of age can do the spirometry test correctly.</p>

	<h2>
			Exercise Testing 
	</h2>
		<div class="row", align="Justify">
			<p > 
			<img src="images/RespiratoryET.jpg" alt="Exercise Testing" style="float:right;width:420px;height:266px;padding:8px;">
			There are different modalities of exercise testing that can provide valuable information to physicians about patient and athlete fitness and cardiopulmonary status.
			Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX) is a form of exercise testing that measures ventilatory and gas exchange, heart rate, electrocardiogram, and blood pressures to 
			provide detailed information on the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and muscular systems. This testing allows an accurate quantification of functional capacity/measure of 
			exercise tolerance, diagnosis of cardiopulmonary disease, disease-progression monitoring or response to intervention, and the prescription of exercise and training.
			CPX directly measures inhaled and exhaled ventilator gases to determine the maximal oxygen uptake, which reflects the body's maximal use of oxygen and defines the limits
			of the cardiopulmonary system. CPX is the ideal modality to evaluate causes of exertional fatigue and dyspnea, especially in complex cases in which the etiology could 
			be cardiac, pulmonary, or deconditioning. Exercise tolerance has become an important outcome measure in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive
			heart failure, as well as other chronic diseases, and is a well-recognized predictor of mortality. Older athletes or those with underlying medical conditions could 
			benefit from exercise testing for risk stratification and clearance to participate, as well as to help set their training zones and determine their functional 
			limitations.</p>
