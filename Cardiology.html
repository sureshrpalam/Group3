			Electrocardiogram(ECG) 
		</h2>

	<div class="row", align="Justify">
		<p > An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a medical test that detects cardiac (heart) abnormalities by measuring the electrical activity generated by the heart as it contracts. 
		The machine that records the patient’s ECG is called an electrocardiograph.</p>
 
		<p>The electrocardiograph records the electrical activity of the heart muscle and displays this data as a trace on a screen or on paper. 
		This data is then interpreted by a medical practitioner.</p>
 
		<p>ECGs from healthy hearts have a characteristic shape. Any irregularity in the heart rhythm or damage to the heart muscle can change the electrical activity of the heart so that the shape of the ECG is changed. 
		A doctor may recommend an ECG for people who may be at risk of heart disease because there is a family history of heart disease, or because they smoke, are overweight, or have diabetes, high cholesterol or high blood pressure.</p>
		
		<p>They may also recommend an ECG if a person is experiencing symptoms such as:</p>
		
		<div class ="row", align="Justify">
			<ol>
				<li> Chest pain </li>
				<li> Shortness of breath </li>
				<li> Dizziness </li>
				<li> Fainting or </li> 
				<li> Fast or irregular heartbeats (palpitations) </li>
			</ol>	
		</div>
		<p>ECGs are often performed to monitor the health of people who have been diagnosed with heart problems, 
		to help assess artificial cardiac pacemakers or to monitor the effects of certain medications on the heart.</p>
		
	</div>
	<h2>
			Exercise Stress Testing 
	</h2>
		<div class="row", align="Justify">
			<p > Exercise stress testing is a validated diagnostic test for coronary artery disease in symptomatic patients, and is used in the evaluation of patients with known 
			cardiac disease. Testing of asymptomatic patients is generally not indicated. It may be performed in select deconditioned adults before starting a vigorous exercise 
			program, but no studies have compared outcomes from preexercise testing vs. encouraging light exercise with gradual increases in exertion. Preoperative exercise stress 
			testing is helpful for risk stratification in patients undergoing vascular surgery or who have active cardiac symptoms before undergoing nonemergent noncardiac surgery.
			Exercise stress testing without imaging is the preferred initial choice for risk stratification in most women. Sensitivity and specificity increase with the use of 
			adjunctive imaging such as echocardiography or myocardial perfusion imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography. Exercise stress testing is rarely an 
			appropriate option to evaluate persons with known coronary artery disease who have no new symptoms less than two years after percutaneous intervention or less than five 
			years after coronary artery bypass grafting. The Duke Treadmill score has excellent prognostic value for exercise stress testing. Imaging is not necessary if patients are 
			able to achieve more than 10 metabolic equivalents on exercise stress testing. Exercise stress testing is not indicated before noncardiac surgeries in patients who can 
			achieve 4 metabolic equivalents without symptoms.</p>

	<h2>
			Cardiac Catheterization 
	</h2>
		<div class="row", align="Justify">
			<p > Cardiac catheterization is used extensively for the diagnosis and treatment of various heart disorders. Cardiac catheterization can be used to measure how much 
			blood the heart pumps out per minute (cardiac output), to detect birth defects of the heart, and to detect and biopsy tumours (for example, a myxoma).</p>
			<div class="col s.span-1-of-4">
			<h3> Heart Catheter</h3>
			<p>This procedure is the only way to directly measure the pressure of blood in each chamber of the heart and in the major blood vessels going from the heart to the lungs.
			In cardiac catheterization, a thin catheter (a small, flexible, hollow plastic tube) is inserted into an artery or vein in the neck, arm, or groin/upper thigh through a 
			puncture made with a needle. A local anesthetic is given to numb the insertion site. The catheter is then threaded through the major blood vessels and into the chambers 
			of the heart. The procedure is done in the hospital and takes 40 to 60 minutes.Various small instruments can be advanced through the tube to the tip of the catheter. 
			They include instruments to measure the pressure of blood in each heart chamber and in blood vessels connected to the heart, to view or take ultrasound images of the 
			interior of blood vessels, to take blood samples from different parts of the heart, or to remove a tissue sample from inside the heart for examination under a microscope</p>
			
			<h3>Catheterization of the right side of the heart</h3>
			<p>Catheterization of the right side of the heart is done to obtain information about the heart chambers on the right side (right atrium and right ventricle) and the 
			tricuspid valve (located between these two chambers). The right atrium receives oxygen-depleted blood from the veins of the body, and the right ventricle pumps the blood
			into the lungs, where blood takes up oxygen and drops off carbon dioxide. In this procedure, the catheter is inserted into a vein, usually in the neck, arm, or the groin.
			Pulmonary artery catheterization,in which a balloon at the catheter's tip is passed through the right atrium and ventricle and lodged in the pulmonary artery, is 
			sometimes done during catheterization of the right side of the heart during certain major operations and in intensive care units. Right-side catheterization is used to detect and quantify abnormal connections
			between the right and left sides of the heart. Doctors usually use right-side catheterization when evaluating people for heart transplantation or for the placement of a 
			mechanical device to help pump blood.</p>

		Cardiac rhythm management device: implantation Testing
	</h2>
		<div class="row", align="Justify">
			<p > Cardiac rhythm management devices perform many functions, including bradycardia pacing, monitoring for arrhythmias, cardiac resynchronisation for heart failure, 
			defibrillation and anti-tachycardia pacing for tachyarrhythmia’s. Concerns regarding potential device-related complications should be discussed with the implanting 
			physician. In the post-implant period, patients with cardiac rhythm management devices can expect to lead normal, active lives. However, caution must occasionally be 
			exercised in certain situations, such as near appliances with electromagnetic interference. Future innovations will move away from transvenous leads to leadless designs
			with combinations of different components on a ‘modular’ basis according to the function required.</p>

	<h2>
		Echocardiography
	</h2>
		<div class="row", align="Justify">
			<p> Echocardiography or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create moving pictures of your heart. The pictures show the size and shape of your heart. 
			They also show how well your heart's chambers and valves are working.</p>
			<p>Echo also can pinpoint areas of heart muscle that aren't contracting well because of poor blood flow or injury from a previous heart attack. A type of echo called 
			Doppler ultrasound shows how well blood flows through your heart's chambers and valves.</p>
			<p>Echo can detect possible blood clots inside the heart, fluid build-up in the pericardium (the sac around the heart), and problems with the aorta. The aorta is the 
			main artery that carries oxygen-rich blood from your heart to your body.</p>
			<p>Doctors also use echo to detect heart problems in infants and children.</p>
